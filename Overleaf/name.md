%%%%%%%%% TODO LIST



Tom's list

Content:

Jamie: Fill in the details of the continuity proof (continuity under changes of the constraints, currently there is only continuity under changes of the objective function)
Tom and Atul: Discuss together and write up the argument for applying the continuity and the robust self-testing statements to WCF protocol. We can consider a single WCF subprotocol or the full protocol consisting of many WCF protocols, like Jamie suggested.
Form

Atul: Structuring paper: Currently there are some repetitions like the estimation of GHZ, and some parts we said would go to he appendix. We could discuss this so that we agree on a structure (unless you two already have a clear structure in mind). NB: This takes some time, especially when making sure that all the transitions stay consistent. So one of us can help with that.
Jamie: Updating references: I saw that Jamie put some comments saying that references are missing.
Tom: make figure of protocol 1 (the original DI WCF protocol). Are other figures necessary ? What about a “ladder” when composing the protocol many times with itself.
All: proofread the paper in detail by some deadline, so that we are all ok with what is in it
