 Our improvement is due to three ingredients: a self-testing/ridigity of
 GHZ step, an extra cheat detection step for Bob and a new bias suppression
 technique that ekes out further security from the abort probability.

\begin_layout Standard
Secure two-party computation is a cryptographic setting where two parties,
 conventionally called Alice and Bob, receive inputs 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and their goal is to compute some function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{A}(x,y)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B}(x,y)$
\end_inset

 respectively which depends on both their inputs.
 However, they do not wish to reveal their inputs.
 Coin flipping (CF) is a cryptographic primitive in this setting, i.e.
 a building block for constructing more applicable secure two-party cryptographi
c schemes, where Alice and Bob wish to exchange messages and agree on a
 random bit, without trusting each other.
 A protocol that implements coin flipping must protect an honest player
 from a malicious

\end_layout

\end_inset

 player.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A weaker primitive, unsurprisingly, known as Weak Coin Flipping (WCF) is
 where a zero corresponds to Alice winning and one corresponds to Bob winning.
 It is weaker because now the protocol has to protect Alice from a malicious
 Bob who tries to bias the outcome towards one (and not towards zero) and
 conversely, it must protect Bob from a malicious Alice who tries to bias
 the outcome towards zero (and not towards one).
 To emphasise the distinction, the former primitive is often termed Strong
 Coin Flipping (SCF).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We primarily focus on WCF in this article and begin with introducing some
 notation.
 We denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}$
\end_inset

 the highest probability of a malicious Alice convincing an honest Bob that
 she won (i.e.
 in the WCF protocol, Alice uses her best cheating strategy against Bob
 who in turn is following the protocol as described, to convince him that
 the outcome is zero).
 Analogously, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the highest probability of a malicious Bob convincing an honest Alice
 that he won.
 The bias of a WCF protocol is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon:=\max\left\{ P_{A}^{*},P_{B}^{*}\right\} -\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 A protocol that is completely secure, has 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0$
\end_inset

 and one that is completely insecure has 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a classical channel of communication between Alice and Bob, unless
 one makes further assumptions such as computational hardness of certain
 problems or relativistic assumptions,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
in terms of the spatial locations of the observers; not to be confused with
 the term 
\emph on
relativising
\emph default
 from computational complexity.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 coin flipping (even weak) is impossible to implement with any security,
 i.e.
 for all classical protocols at least one of the parties, i.e.
 a malicious Alice or a malicious Bob, can win with certainty because one
 can show 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 (viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\max\{P_{A}^{*},P_{B}^{*}\}=1$
\end_inset

).
 Using a quantum channel of communication, it was shown that WCF can be
 implemented with vanishing bias.
 These works, however, do not account for noise in their implementation.
 One path towards more robust security is device independence wherein the
 players do not even trust their devices (recall, they already do not trust
 the other party).
 This is in contrast to the device independent setting considered in key
 distribution where the two parties trust each other but neither their devices
 nor the communication channel (TODO: is the classical communication channel
 trusted?).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, we start with a device independent (DI) weak coin flipping
 (WCF) protocol introduced
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, they introduced a device independent bit commitment protocol which
 they in turn use to construct a strong coin flipping protocol with the
 same cheating probabilities for Alice and Bob, 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0.854$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.75$
\end_inset

 respectively.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 which has 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}=\cos^{2}(\pi/8)\approx0.854$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}^{*}=3/4=0.75$
\end_inset

.
 They then compose these protocols to give a balanced protocol, i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}=P_{B}^{*}\approx0.336$
\end_inset

.
 To the best of our knowledge, this DI CF protocol has the best security
 guarantee.
 While Kitaev's bound for CF rule out perfect DI CF, no lower bounds on
 the bias are known for DI WCF.
 In this work, however, we focus on improving the upper bound on the bias,
 viz.
 we give DI WCF protocols with lower biases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We introduce two key new ideas which result in better protocols.
 The first, is the use of self-testing by one party before initiating the
 protocol and the second, is a more general technique to convert unbalanced
 protocols (i.e.
 ones in which the probability of maliciously winning for Alice and Bob
 are unequal) into balanced ones.

Slightly anticipating the upcoming discussion, consider the following partially

Three boxes, each of which accept a binary input and produce a binary output,
 are prepared (we do not make any assumptions on who prepares the boxes;
 when we analyse the security, we assume the adversary prepared them).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Alice is given the first box and Bob is given the second and third boxes.
 Further, Bob ensures that his two boxes are shielded to prevent any inter-commu
nication.
 (An alternative is to keep the boxes sufficiently far so that during the
 course of the protocol, not even light can be used to communicate; but
 under such relativistic settings, CF can already be performed, making this
 discussion irrelevant).

Bob uses local randomness (that we assume Alice cannot access) to determine
 the inputs to his box.

1.4) New idea: self-testing.
 Also, no self-testing Alice AND Bob (due to Kitaev).

1.5) Our NEW protocol(s).
 Self-test Alice, Self-test Bob (these are two protocols).
 Their DD security, and why DD security equals DI security (approximately,
 conceptually).

 Final bias.

1.7) Applications: WCF new bias.
 SCF new bias.
 OT new bias.

Here is a crappy DI-OT protocol.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fix two OT protocols, one with P_A,OT* = 1, P_B,OT* = 1/2 and the other
 with P_A,OT* = 1/2, P_B,OT* = 1.

\begin_layout Standard
DI-OT protocol: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 0) Do DI-WCF from our paper.
 Step 1) If no abort, and Alice wins, they use the P_A,OT* = 1 protocol.
 Step 2) If no abort, and Alice loses, they use the P_A,OT* = 1/2 protocol.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This yields a bias of < 1/2.
 Not pretty, but it works.
 There is likely a way to make this better, but it's a first step.
