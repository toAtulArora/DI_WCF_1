We report a device independent weak coin flipping protocol

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}\le\cos^{2}(\pi/8)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}^{*}\le0.667...$
\end_inset

, by making seemingly minor changes to the best known protocol due to SCAKPM'11
 [10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.220501], with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}\le\cos^{2}(\pi/8)\approx0.85$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}^{*}\le3/4=0.75$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of bias, we improved the SCAKPM'11 result from 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0.336$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0.3199$
\end_inset

.
 This improvement is due to two ingredients: a self-testing (of GHZ) step
 and an extra cheat detection step for Bob.
 We also introduce a new bias suppression technique that ekes out further
 security from the abort probability to obtain ...
 Note that the SCAKPM'11 result held for both strong and weak coin flipping;
 ours holds only for the latter.

\begin_layout Standard
Secure two-party computation is a cryptographic setting where two parties,
 conventionally called Alice and Bob, receive inputs 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and their goal is to compute some function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{A}(x,y)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B}(x,y)$
\end_inset

 respectively which depends on both their inputs.
 However, they do not wish to reveal their inputs.
 Coin flipping (CF) is a cryptographic primitive in this setting, i.e.
 a building block for constructing more applicable secure two-party cryptographi
c schemes, where Alice and Bob wish to exchange messages and agree on a
 random bit, without trusting each other.
 A protocol that implements coin flipping must protect an honest player
 from a malicious

\end_layout

\end_inset

 player.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A weaker primitive, unsurprisingly, known as 
\emph on
weak coin flipping
\emph default
 (WCF) is where a zero corresponds to Alice winning and one corresponds
 to Bob winning.
 It is weaker because now the protocol has to protect Alice from a malicious
 Bob who tries to bias the outcome towards one (and not towards zero) and
 conversely, it must protect Bob from a malicious Alice who tries to bias
 the outcome towards zero (and not towards one).
 To emphasise the distinction, the former primitive is often termed 
\emph on
strong coin flipping
\emph default
 (SCF).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We primarily focus on WCF in this article and begin with introducing some
 notation.
 We denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}$
\end_inset

 the highest probability of a malicious Alice convincing an honest Bob that
 she won (i.e.
 in the WCF protocol, Alice uses her best cheating strategy against Bob
 who in turn is following the protocol as described, to convince him that
 the outcome is zero).
 Analogously, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the highest probability of a malicious Bob convincing an honest Alice
 that he won.
 The bias of a WCF protocol is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon:=\max\left\{ P_{A}^{*},P_{B}^{*}\right\} -\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 A protocol that is completely secure, has 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0$
\end_inset

 and one that is completely insecure has 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a classical channel of communication between Alice and Bob, unless
 one makes further assumptions such as computational hardness of certain
 problems or relativistic assumptions,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
in terms of the spatial locations of the observers; not to be confused with
 the term 
\emph on
relativising
\emph default
 from computational complexity.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 coin flipping (even weak) is impossible to implement with any security,
 to wit: for all classical protocols at least one of the parties, viz.
 a malicious Alice or a malicious Bob, can win with certainty because one
 can show 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 (viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\max\{P_{A}^{*},P_{B}^{*}\}=1$
\end_inset

).
 Using a quantum channel of communication, it was shown that WCF can be
 implemented with vanishing bias.
 These works, however, do not account for noise in their implementation.
 One path towards more robust security is device independence wherein the
 players do not even trust their devices (recall, they already do not trust
 the other party).
 This is in contrast to the device independent setting considered in key
 distribution where the two parties trust each other but neither their devices
 nor the communication channel (TODO: is the classical communication channel
 trusted?).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, we start with a device independent (DI) coin flipping (CF)
 protocol introduced
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, they introduced a device independent bit commitment protocol which
 they in turn use to construct a strong coin flipping protocol with the
 same cheating probabilities for Alice and Bob, 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0.854$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.75$
\end_inset

 respectively.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 which has 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}=\cos^{2}(\pi/8)\approx0.854$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}^{*}=3/4=0.75$
\end_inset

.
 They then compose these protocols to give a balanced protocol, i.e.
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}=P_{B}^{*}\approx\frac{1}{2}+0.336$
\end_inset

.
 To the best of our knowledge, this DI CF protocol has the best security
 guarantee.
 While Kitaev's bound for CF rule out perfect DI CF, no lower bounds on
 the bias are known for DI WCF.
 In this work, however, we focus on improving the upper bound on the bias,
 viz.
 we give DI WCF protocols with biases 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0.319$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We introduce two key new ideas which result in better protocols.
 The first, is the use of self-testing by one party before initiating the
 protocol and the second, is a more general technique to convert unbalanced
 protocols (i.e.
 ones in which the probability of maliciously winning for Alice and Bob
 are unequal) into balanced ones.

We describe device independent protocols as classical protocols with the
 one modification: we assume that the two parties can exchange boxes and
 that the parties can shield their boxes (from the other boxes i.e.
 the boxes can't communicate with each other once shielded).

TODO: Verify if this notion is in fact correct; I hope I'm not making a
 major mistake somehow.
 I should be able to take the POVMs as tensor products right, because I
 can change them at will, independent of the others (and ensuring that there's
 no communication between them; could they be somehow entangled, i.e.
 could it be that somehow the measurement operators are themselves quantum
 correlated?); I would like to reach the conclusion starting from the locality
 assumption.

Slightly anticipating the upcoming discussion, consider the following partially

\begin_layout Itemize
Three boxes, each of which accept a binary input and produce a binary output,
 are prepared (we do not make any assumptions on who prepares the boxes;
 when we analyse the security, we assume the adversary prepared them).

\begin_layout Itemize
Alice is given the first box and Bob is given the second and third boxes.
 Further, Bob ensures that his two boxes are shielded to prevent any inter-commu
nication.
 (An alternative is to keep the boxes sufficiently far so that during the
 course of the protocol, not even light can be used to communicate; but
 under such relativistic settings, CF can already be performed, making this
 discussion irrelevant).

Bob uses local randomness (that we assume Alice cannot access) to determine
 the inputs to his box.

\begin_layout Standard
We make two observations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "alg:SCForiginal"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 only Bob performs the test round.
 In WCF, there is a notion of Alice winning and Bob winning.
 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\oplus g=0$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the outcome corresponding to 
\begin_inset Quotes bls
\end_inset

Alice wins
\begin_inset Quotes brs
\end_inset

, we can imagine that Bob continues to perform the test to ensure (at least
 to some extend) that Alice did not cheat.
 However, if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\oplus g=1$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the outcome corresponding to 
\begin_inset Quotes bls
\end_inset

Bob wins
\begin_inset Quotes brs
\end_inset

, we can require Alice to now complete the GHZ test to ensure that Bob did
 not cheat.
 It turns out that this does not lower 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Interestingly, the best cheating strategy deviates from the GHZ state and
 measurements for the honest player.
 We omit the details here (see TODO: write this down somewhere) but mention
 this to motivate the following.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, Alice (say) can harness the self-testing property of GHZ states
 and measurements to ensure that Bob has not tampered with her boxes.
 One way of proceeding is that 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 copies of the supposedly correct boxes are distributed.
 Alice now picks one out of these 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 boxes at random and asks Bob to send the associated two boxes to each 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 box that Alice posses.
 Alice runs the GHZ test on each box and if even one test fails, she declares
 that Bob cheated.
 This way, for a large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, Alice can ensure with near certainty, that she has a box containing the
 correct state and (which performs the correct) measurements.
 Note that no such scheme can be concocted which simultaneously self-tests
 Alice and Bob's boxes.
 More precisely, no such procedure can ensure that Alice and Bob share a
 GHZ state (Alice one part, Bob the other two, for instance) because this
 would mean perfect (or near perfect) SCF is possible which is forbidden
 even in the device dependent case.
 Kitaev showed that for any SCF protocol, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\ge\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining these two observations, results in an improvement in the security
 for Alice.
 We obtain a protocol with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{A}^{*}\le3/4$
\end_inset

, which is the same as before, but 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{B}^{*}\apprle0.667...$

Consider a WCF protocol, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{A}$
\end_inset

, where the success probability of cheating Alice is greater than that of
 cheating Bob.
 We denote this by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{A}^{*}(\mathcal{P}_{A})=\alpha>\beta=p_{B}^{*}(\mathcal{P}_{A}).
\]

\end_inset

The subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{A}$
\end_inset

 simply represents that Alice has the advantage.
 By 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{B}$
\end_inset

 we denote the same protocol is run with Alice's and Bob's roles swapped.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{A}^{*}(\mathcal{P}_{B})=\beta<\alpha=p_{B}^{*}(\mathcal{P}_{A}).
\]

\end_inset

One can compose these protocols, into a new protocol 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}'_{A}$
\end_inset

 as follows (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Standard-composition-technique"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

): Alice and Bob run 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{A}$
\end_inset

 (to decide whether they run 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{A}$
\end_inset

 in the subsequent round or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{B}$
\end_inset

).
 If the outcome is 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, they run 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{A}$
\end_inset

 and if the outcome is 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, they run 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 The outcome of this round, determines the outcome of the full protocol.
 It is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p_{A}^{*}(\mathcal{P}'_{A}) & =\alpha^{2}+(1-\alpha)\beta=:\alpha^{(1)},\quad\text{and}\\
p_{B}^{*}(\mathcal{P}'_{A}) & =\beta\alpha+(1-\beta)\beta=:\beta^{(1)}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

One can repeat this procedure with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}'_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}'_{B}$
\end_inset

 (which is defined by switching the roles of Alice and Bob in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}'_{A}$
\end_inset

) to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}''_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}''_{B}$
\end_inset

, together with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{(2)}$
\end_inset

.
 More explicitly, one can write, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\alpha^{(i+1)} & =(\alpha^{(i)})^{2}+(1-\alpha^{(i)})\beta^{(i)}\\
\beta^{(i+1)} & =\beta^{(i)}\alpha^{(i)}+(1-\beta^{(i)})\beta^{(i)}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Applying this to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{(0)}=\cos^{2}(\pi/8)\approx0.852$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{(0)}\apprle0.667$
\end_inset

, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha^{(n)}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\beta^{(n)}\approx0.8199\dots
\]

\end_inset

which yields the biases stated in the previous subsection.

 We did this, for instance when Alice cheats, by assuming that the probability
 of Bob winning is

 However, this probability actually constitutes two events: first, that
 Bob deduces he wins and second, that Bob detects Alice cheating (for instance,
 when the GHZ test fails).

 he declares himself the winner.
