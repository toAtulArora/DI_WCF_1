  abstract     = {We present a quantum protocol for the task of weak coin flipping. We find that, for one choice of parameters in the protocol, the maximum probability of a dishonest party winning the coin flip if the other party is honest is 1/sqrt(2). We also show that if parties restrict themselves to strategies wherein they cannot be caught cheating, their maximum probability of winning can be even smaller. As such, the protocol offers additional security in the form of cheat sensitivity.},

@article{DKLR11,
	Abstract = {We study a model of communication complexity that encompasses many well-studied problems, including classical and quantum communication complexity, the complexity of simulating distributions arising from bipartite measurements of shared quantum states, and XOR games. In this model, Alice gets an input \$x\$, Bob gets an input \$y\$, and their goal is to each produce an output \$a,b\$ distributed according to some pre-specified joint distribution \$p(a,b|x,y)\$. Our results apply to any non-signaling distribution, that is, those where Alice's marginal distribution does not depend on Bob's input, and vice versa. By taking a geometric view of the non-signaling distributions, we introduce a simple new technique based on affine combinations of lower-complexity distributions, and we give the first general technique to apply to all these settings, with elementary proofs and very intuitive interpretations. Specifically, we introduce two complexity measures, one which gives lower bounds on classical communication, and one for quantum communication. These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems. We show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they coincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual expressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. Despite their apparent simplicity, these lower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods, most notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special case of Boolean functions. We show that as in the case of Boolean functions, the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at most linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend on the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between maximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known only for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals. It also allows us to show that for some distributions, information theoretic methods are necessary to prove strong lower bounds. Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical communication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any non-signaling distribution. One consequence of this is a simple proof that any quantum distribution can be approximated with a constant number of bits of communication.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new quantum adversary method to prove lower bounds on the query complexity of the quantum state generation problem. This problem encompasses both, the computation of partial or total functions and the preparation of target quantum states. There has been hope for quite some time that quantum state generation might be a route to tackle the \{$\backslash$sc Graph Isomorphism\} problem. We show that for the related problem of \{$\backslash$sc Index Erasure\} our method leads to a lower bound of \$\backslash Omega(\backslash sqrt N)\$ which matches an upper bound obtained via reduction to quantum search on \$N\$ elements. This closes an open problem first raised by Shi [FOCS'02]. Our approach is based on two ideas: (i) on the one hand we generalize the known additive and multiplicative adversary methods to the case of quantum state generation, (ii) on the other hand we show how the symmetries of the underlying problem can be leveraged for the design of optimal adversary matrices and dramatically simplify the computation of adversary bounds. Taken together, these two ideas give the new result for \{$\backslash$sc Index Erasure\} by using the representation theory of the symmetric group. Also, the method can lead to lower bounds even for small success probability, contrary to the standard adversary method. Furthermore, we answer an open question due to $\backslash$v\{S\}palek [CCC'08] by showing that the multiplicative version of the adversary method is stronger than the additive one for any problem. Finally, we prove that the multiplicative bound satisfies a strong direct product theorem, extending a result by $\backslash$v\{S\}palek to quantum state generation problems.},

	Abstract = {It is known that quantum correlations exhibited by a maximally entangled qubit pair can be simulated with the help of shared randomness, supplemented with additional resources, such as communication, post-selection or non-local boxes. For instance, in the case of projective measurements, it is possible to solve this problem with protocols using one bit of communication or making one use of a non-local box. We show that this problem reduces to a distributed sampling problem. We give a new method to obtain samples from a biased distribution, starting with shared random variables following a uniform distribution, and use it to build distributed sampling protocols. This approach allows us to derive, in a simpler and unified way, many existing protocols for projective measurements, and extend them to positive operator value measurements. Moreover, this approach naturally leads to a local hidden variable model for Werner states.},

The number of steps of the quantum walk is quadratically smaller than the classical hitting time of any reversible random walk P on the graph. Our approach is new, simpler and more general than previous ones. We introduce a notion of interpolation between the walk P and the absorbing walk P′, whose marked states are absorbing. Then our quantum walk is simply the quantum analogue of the interpolation. Contrary to previous approaches, our results remain valid when the random walk P is not state-transitive, and in the presence of multiple marked vertices. As a consequence we make a progress on an open problem related to the spatial search on the 2D-grid.},

	Abstract = {A non-local box is an abstract device into which Alice and Bob input bits $x$ and $y$ respectively and receive outputs $a$ and $b$, where $a,b$ are uniformly distributed and $a \oplus b = x \wedge y$. Such boxes have been central to the study of quantum or generalized non-locality, as well as the simulation of non-signaling distributions. In this paper, we start by studying how many non-local boxes Alice and Bob need in order to compute a Boolean function $f$. We provide tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the communication complexity of the function both in the deterministic and randomized case. We show that non-local box complexity has interesting applications to classical cryptography, in particular to secure function evaluation, and study the question posed by Beimel and Malkin of how many Oblivious Transfer calls Alice and Bob need in order to securely compute a function $f$. We show that this question is related to the non-local box complexity of the function and conclude by greatly improving their bounds. Finally, another consequence of our results is that traceless two-outcome measurements on maximally entangled states can be simulated with 3 non-local boxes, while no finite bound was previously known. },

abstract = {The polynomial method and the adversary method are the two main techniques to prove lower bounds on quantum query complexity, and they have so far been considered as unrelated approaches. Here, we show an explicit reduction from the polynomial method to the multiplicative adversary method. The proof goes by extending the polynomial method from Boolean functions to quantum state generation problems. In the process, the bound is even strengthened. We then show that this extended polynomial method is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method with an adversary matrix that is independent of the function. This new result therefore provides insight on the reason why in some cases the adversary method is stronger than the polynomial method. It also reveals a clear picture of the relation between the different lower bound techniques, as it implies that all known techniques reduce to the multiplicative adversary method.},

	Abstract = {We show that almost all known lower bound methods for communication complexity are also lower bounds for the information complexity. In particular, we define a relaxed version of the partition bound of Jain and Klauck and prove that it lower bounds the information complexity of any function. Our relaxed partition bound subsumes all norm based methods (e.g. the factorization norm method) and rectangle-based methods (e.g. the rectangle/corruption bound, the smooth rectangle bound, and the discrepancy bound), except the partition bound. Our result uses a new connection between rectangles and zero-communication protocols where the players can either output a value or abort. We prove the following compression lemma: given a protocol for a function f with information complexity I, one can construct a zero-communication protocol that has non-abort probability at least 2\^{}\{-O(I)\} and that computes f correctly with high probability conditioned on not aborting. Then, we show how such a zero-communication protocol relates to the relaxed partition bound. We use our main theorem to resolve three of the open questions raised by Braverman. First, we show that the information complexity of the Vector in Subspace Problem is \{$\backslash$Omega\}(n\^{}\{1/3\}), which, in turn, implies that there exists an exponential separation between quantum communication complexity and classical information complexity. Moreover, we provide an \{$\backslash$Omega\}(n) lower bound on the information complexity of the Gap Hamming Distance Problem.},

	Abstract = {In communication complexity, two players each have an input and they wish to compute some function of the joint inputs. This has been the object of much study and a wide variety of lower bound methods have been introduced to address the problem of showing lower bounds on communication. Recently, Jain and Klauck introduced the partition bound, which subsumes many of the known methods, in particular factorization norm, discrepancy, and the rectangle (corruption) bound. Physicists have considered a closely related scenario where two players share a predefined entangled state. Each is given a measurement as input, which they perform on their share of the system. The outcomes of the measurements follow a distribution which is predicted by quantum mechanics. In an experimental setting, Bell inequalities are used to distinguish truly quantum from classical behavior. We present a new lower bound technique based on the notion of detector inefficiency (where some runs are discarded by either of the players) for the extended setting of simulating distributions, and show that it coincides with the partition bound in the case of computing functions. The dual form is more feasible to use, and we show that it amounts to constructing an explicit Bell inequality. We also give a lower bound on quantum communication complexity which can be viewed as a quantum extension of the rectangle bound, effectively overcoming the necessity of a quantum minmax theorem. For one-way communication, we show that the quantum one-way partition bound is tight for classical communication with shared entanglement up to arbitrarily small error. Finally, an important goal in physics is to devise robust Bell experiments that are impervious to noise and detector inefficiency. We make further progress towards this by giving a general tradeoff between communication, Bell inequality violation, and detector efficiency.},

abstract = {We solve an open problem by constructing quantum walks that not only detect but also find marked vertices in a graph. In the case when the marked set \$M\$ consists of a single vertex, the number of steps of the quantum walk is quadratically smaller than the classical hitting time \$HT(P,M)\$ of any reversible random walk \$P\$ on the graph. In the case of multiple marked elements, the number of steps is given in terms of a related quantity \$HT\^{}+(\backslash mathit\{P,M\})\$ which we call extended hitting time. Our approach is new, simpler and more general than previous ones. We introduce a notion of interpolation between the random walk \$P\$ and the absorbing walk \$P'\$, whose marked states are absorbing. Then our quantum walk is simply the quantum analogue of this interpolation. Contrary to previous approaches, our results remain valid when the random walk \$P\$ is not state-transitive. We also provide algorithms in the cases when only approximations or bounds on parameters \$p\_M\$ (the probability of picking a marked vertex from the stationary distribution) and \$HT\^{}+(\backslash mathit\{P,M\})\$ are known.},

<H3>Abstract</H3>
Quantum query complexity is known to be characterized by the so-called quantum adversary bound. While this result has been proved in the standard discrete-time model of quantum computation, it also holds for continuous-time (or Hamiltonian-based) quantum computation, due to a known equivalence between these two query complexity models. In this work, we revisit this result by providing a direct proof in the continuous-time model. One originality of our proof is that it draws new connections between the adversary bound, a modern technique of theoretical computer science, and early theorems of quantum mechanics. Indeed, the proof of the lower bound is based on Ehrenfest's theorem, while the upper bound relies on the adiabatic theorem, as it goes by constructing a universal adiabatic quantum query algorithm. Another originality is that we use for the first time in the context of quantum computation a version of the adiabatic theorem that does not require a spectral gap.

As such, the protocol offers additional security in the form of cheat sensitivity.},

  abstract   = {We focus on a family of quantum coin-flipping protocols based on bit-commitment. We discuss how the semidefinite programming formulations of cheating strategies can be reduced to optimizing a linear combination of fidelity functions over a polytope. These turn out to be much simpler semidefinite programs which can be modelled using second-order cone programming problems. We then use these simplifications to construct their point games as developed by Kitaev. We also study the classical version of these protocols and use linear optimization to formulate optimal cheating strategies. We then construct the point games for the classical protocols as well using the analysis for the quantum case. We discuss the philosophical connections between the classical and quantum protocols and their point games as viewed from optimization theory. In particular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from classical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from linear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone programming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear programming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is correlated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming models on the optimization side. Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that every classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to entirely determine the coin-flip. Using the relationships between the quantum and classical protocols, we show that only "classical" protocols can saturate Kitaev's lower bound for strong coin-flipping. Moreover, if the product of Alice and Bob's optimal cheating probabilities is 1/2, then one party can cheat with probability 1. This rules out quantum protocols of this type from attaining the optimal level of security.},

This work gives a simple algorithm that does it, based on the weak coin flipping protocol with arbitrarily small bias derived by Mochon in 2007, and recently published and simplified in Aharonov et al in 2016. A protocol with linear number of coin flipping rounds is quite simple to achieve; We further provide an improvement to logarithmic number of coin flipping rounds. This is a much improved journal version of a preprint posted in 2009: many typos are corrected, proofs are more rigorous and accurate, and the analysis of complexity is significantly tightened which gives a stronger result in terms of efficiency; The first protocol with linear number of rounds, was achieved independently also by Aharon and Silman in 2010.},

We present an optimal security bound for quantum oblivious transfer protocols under a natural and demanding definition of what it means for Alice to cheat. Our lower bound is a smooth tradeoff between the probability B with which Bob can guess Alice's bit choice and the probability A with which Alice can guess both of Bob's bits given that she learns one of the bits with certainty. We prove that 2B + A is greater than or equal to 2 in any quantum protocol for oblivious transfer, from which it follows that one of the two parties must be able to cheat with probability at least 2/3. We prove that this bound is optimal by exhibiting a family of protocols whose cheating probabilities can be made arbitrarily close to any point on the tradeoff curve.},

In addition, we make use of this last result to introduce a family of optimal 2m-party strong n^m-sided dice rolling protocols for any value of m and n.},

  title       = {Quantum Weak Coin Flipping},
  abstract    = {We investigate weak coin flipping, a fundamental cryptographic primitive where two distrustful parties need to remotely establish a shared random bit. A cheating player can try to bias the output bit towards a preferred value. For weak coin flipping the players have known opposite preferred values. A weak coin-flipping protocol has a bias $\epsilon$ if neither player can force the outcome towards their preferred value with probability more than $\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$. While it is known that classically $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$, Mochon showed in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114] that quantumly weak coin flipping can be achieved with arbitrarily small bias (near perfect) but the best known explicit protocol has bias 1/6 (also due to Mochon, 2005 [Phys. Rev. A 72, 022341]). We propose a framework to construct new explicit protocols achieving biases beyond 1/6. In particular, we construct explicit unitaries for protocols with bias up to 1/10. To go beyond, we introduce what we call the Elliptic Monotone Align (EMA) algorithm which, together with the framework, allows us to construct protocols with arbitrarily small biases. This solves the open problem of quantum weak coin flipping (in the absence of noise).},

  title       = {The Impossibility of Efficient Quantum Weak Coin-Flipping},
  abstract    = {How can two parties with competing interests carry out a fair coin flip, using only a noiseless quantum channel? This problem (quantum weak coin-flipping) was formalized more than 15 years ago, and, despite some phenomenal theoretical progress, practical quantum coin-flipping protocols with vanishing bias have proved hard to find. In the current work we show that there is a reason that practical weak quantum coin-flipping is difficult: any quantum weak coin-flipping protocol with bias $\epsilon$ must use at least $\exp ( \Omega (1/\sqrt{\epsilon} ))$ rounds of communication. This is a large improvement over the previous best known lower bound of $\Omega ( \log \log (1/\epsilon ))$ due to Ambainis from 2004. Our proof is based on a theoretical construction (the two-variable profile function) which may find further applications.},

	abstract = "There had been well-known claims of unconditionally secure quantum protocols for bit commitment. However, we, and independently Mayers, showed that all proposed quantum bit commitment schemes are, in principle, insecure because the sender, Alice, can almost always cheat successfully by using an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type of attack and delaying her measurements. One might wonder if secure quantum bit commitment protocols exist at all. We answer this question by showing that the same type of attack by Alice will, in principle, break any bit commitment scheme. The cheating strategy generally requires a quantum computer. We emphasize the generality of this âno-go theoremâ: Unconditionally secure bit commitment schemes based on quantum mechanics-fully quantum, classical or quantum but with measurements-are all ruled out by this result. Since bit commitment is a useful primitive for building up more sophisticated protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, our results cast very serious doubt on the security of quantum cryptography in the so-called âpost-cold-warâ applications. We also show that ideal quantum coin tossing is impossible because of the EPR attack. This no-go theorem for ideal quantum coin tossing may help to shed some lights on the possibility of non-ideal protocols."

  abstract      = {In this work we consider the interplay between multiprover interactive proofs, quantum entanglement, and zero knowledge proofs - notions that are central pillars of complexity theory, quantum information and cryptography. In particular, we study the relationship between the complexity class MIP$^*$, the set of languages decidable by multiprover interactive proofs with quantumly entangled provers, and the class PZKMIP$^*$, which is the set of languages decidable by MIP$^*$ protocols that furthermore possess the perfect zero knowledge property. Our main result is that the two classes are equal, i.e., MIP$^* =$ PZKMIP$^*$. This result provides a quantum analogue of the celebrated result of Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian, and Wigderson (STOC 1988) who show that MIP $=$ PZKMIP (in other words, all classical multiprover interactive protocols can be made zero knowledge). We prove our result by showing that every MIP$^*$ protocol can be efficiently transformed into an equivalent zero knowledge MIP$^*$ protocol in a manner that preserves the completeness-soundness gap. Combining our transformation with previous results by Slofstra (Forum of Mathematics, Pi 2019) and Fitzsimons, Ji, Vidick and Yuen (STOC 2019), we obtain the corollary that all co-recursively enumerable languages (which include undecidable problems as well as all decidable problems) have zero knowledge MIP$^*$ protocols with vanishing promise gap.},

  abstract      = {Quantum computers are expected to be better at solving certain computational problems than classical computers. This expectation is based on (well-founded) conjectures in computational complexity theory, but rigorous comparisons between the capabilities of quantum and classical algorithms are difficult to perform. Bravyi et al. proved theoretically that whereas the number of {\textquotedblleft}steps{\textquotedblright} needed by parallel quantum circuits to solve certain linear algebra problems was independent of the problem size, this number grew logarithmically with size for analogous classical circuits (see the Perspective by Montanaro). This so-called quantum advantage stems from the quantum correlations present in quantum circuits that cannot be reproduced in analogous classical circuits.Science, this issue p. 308; see also p. 289Quantum effects can enhance information-processing capabilities and speed up the solution of certain computational problems. Whether a quantum advantage can be rigorously proven in some setting or demonstrated experimentally using near-term devices is the subject of active debate. We show that parallel quantum algorithms running in a constant time period are strictly more powerful than their classical counterparts; they are provably better at solving certain linear algebra problems associated with binary quadratic forms. Our work gives an unconditional proof of a computational quantum advantage and simultaneously pinpoints its origin: It is a consequence of quantum nonlocality. The proposed quantum algorithm is a suitable candidate for near-future experimental realizations, as it requires only constant-depth quantum circuits with nearest-neighbor gates on a two-dimensional grid of qubits (quantum bits).},

Perhaps the most conservative resolution is that the infalling observer burns up at the horizon. Alternatives would seem to require novel dynamics that nevertheless cause notable violations of semiclassical physics at macroscopic distances from the horizon.},

  __markedentry = {[toatu:6]},
  abstract      = {Query complexity is a model of computation in which we have to compute a function $f(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ of variables $x_i$ which can be accessed via queries. The complexity of an algorithm is measured by the number of queries that it makes. Query complexity is widely used for studying quantum algorithms, for two reasons. First, it includes many of the known quantum algorithms (including Grover's quantum search and a key subroutine of Shor's factoring algorithm). Second, one can prove lower bounds on the query complexity, bounding the possible quantum advantage. In the last few years, there have been major advances on several longstanding problems in the query complexity. In this talk, we survey these results and related work, including: - the biggest quantum-vs-classical gap for partial functions (a problem solvable with 1 query quantumly but requiring $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ queries classically); - the biggest quantum-vs-determistic and quantum-vs-probabilistic gaps for total functions (for example, a problem solvable with $M$ queries quantumly but requiring $\tilde{\Omega}(M^{2.5})$ queries probabilistically); - the biggest probabilistic-vs-deterministic gap for total functions (a problem solvable with $M$ queries probabilistically but requiring $\tilde{\Omega}(M^{2})$ queries deterministically); - the bounds on the gap that can be achieved for subclasses of functions (for example, symmetric functions); - the connections between query algorithms and approximations by low-degree polynomials.},

  __markedentry = {[toatu:6]},
  abstract      = {We investigate weak coin flipping, a fundamental cryptographic primitive where two distrustful parties need to remotely establish a shared random bit. A cheating player can try to bias the output bit towards a preferred value. A weak coin-flipping protocol has a bias $\epsilon$ if neither player can force the outcome towards their preferred value with probability more than $1/2+\epsilon$. While it is known that classically $\epsilon=1/2$, Mochon showed in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114] that quantumly weak coin flipping can be achieved with arbitrarily small bias, i.e. $\epsilon(k)=1/(4k+2)$ for arbitrarily large $k$, and he proposed an explicit protocol approaching bias $1/6$. So far, the best known explicit protocol is the one by Arora, Roland and Weis, with $\epsilon(2)=1/10$ (corresponding to $k=2$) [STOC'19, p. 205-216]. In the current work, we present the construction of protocols approaching arbitrarily close to zero bias, i.e. $\epsilon(k)$ for arbitrarily large $k$. We connect the algebraic properties of Mochon's assignments---at the heart of his proof of existence---with the geometric properties of the unitaries whose existence he proved. It is this connection that allows us to find these unitaries analytically.},
