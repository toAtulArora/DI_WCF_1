\begin_layout Section
Notes from the meetings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We follow two approaches with the common goal of constructing better protocols
 than the ones currently known.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meeting/afterthoughts 1 | Monday
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jamie cooked up a bunch of protocols.
 Here's the rough list of things to pursue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Explore the viability of the J0 protocol, proposed by Jamie.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We also had to determine if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fully distrustful
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 article had a better bias for device independent (strong) coin flipping
 (EDIT: it did) than the device independent weak coin flipping protocol,
 by essentially the same authors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
My task was to try to formalise the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

formalism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meeting/afterthoughts 2 | Tuesday
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were a few ideas which were floated around by Jamie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
F1 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{?}{\iff}$
\end_inset

 F2 where F1 is the first framework and F2 is this one: since in DI protocols,
 we can start with any arbitrary state, consider these, followed by only
 classical information, then one last step where a part of the system is
 sent to the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Understand the GHZ based protocols and re-express them using the F1 framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meeting/afterthoughts 3 | Thursday [with Tom]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I read and presented the PRL protocol (without the security analysis).
 Then I tried presenting the equivalence of the two frameworks, intuitively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It looks like we can use Jamie's idea; call it the J3 protocol.
 It basically adds an additional verification step and since it is for weak
 CF, it doesn't affect the bias for Bob.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tom said that allowing quantum communication can be used to break the security
 because the quantum device can encode and send the input it was fed and
 since we allow the adversary to control the quantum channels, this makes
 them too powerful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
True but does learning the other player's input (maybe not always but sometimes)
 necessarily mean they have too much power? The only sane conclusion I can
 draw from this is that one has to necessarily allow classical information
 to be communicated but perhaps allowing quantum communication is also relevant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Why isn't teleportation enough? In the honest case it is clearly enough.
 We want to show that in the dishonest case, the two models are equivalent.
 The two models being, one with classical + quantum communication the other
 with only classical communication.
 In both, we allow an arbitrary number of devices to be shared (which may
 be shielded to enforce the required structure for non-locality).
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Question: I have to show that a strategy in one can be equivalently expressed
 in the other.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Meeting/afterthoughts 4 | Monday
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I explained the framework; with things much better formalised and with higher
 clarity about how to impose the constraints for a cheating Bob.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Jamie pointed out how some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self-testing of unitaries
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 like scheme wouldn't quite work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I forgot to ask him, thereafter, how to treat post measurement states of
 boxes (if at all this makes sense).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Jamie then explained his abort based protocol which seemingly improves the
 bias; intuitively, this helps when you compose protocols: if you catch
 a player cheating, you just abort, instead of playing further and getting
 cheated further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meeting/afterthoughts 5 | Tuesday [with Tom]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Jamie presented his new abort based protocols.
 Tom seemed to be ok with the ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I presented the proofs of Alice's and Bob's security.
 We compared it with Jamie's direct analysis and saw where they differed.
 We worked towards characterising the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{c}$
\end_inset

, where in addition to the probability that Alice succeeds in convincing
 Bob, we keep track of the probability of her getting caught cheating.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tom also pointed out an oversight about testing Bob; we were sending both
 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{A}$
\end_inset

 to Bob, before testing him.
 We must delay the sending of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{A}$
\end_inset

 else he can pass the test with certainty.

\begin_layout Standard
[IGNORE THIS] The idea in this section is two-fold: the first is that a
 given coin flipping protocol may be re-analysed for its abort behaviour
 and the second is that coin flipping protocols with the possibility of
 aborting may be composed to obtain overall better protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us start with an intuitive discussion.
 Suppose we are given a WCF protocol, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 which in the honest case case has 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}=\left(p_{A},p_{B},p_{A\perp},P_{B\perp}\right)$
\end_inset

 and it encodes the probabilities of Alice winning, Bob winning, Alice aborting
 and Bob aborting respectively.
 For simplicity, we assume that in the honest case, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}=p_{B}=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A\perp}=p_{B\perp}=0$
\end_inset

.
 We thus have, for the honest case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}=\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},0,0\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Consider the case where Alice cheats and Bob is honest.
 Suppose there exists a strategy for Alice such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}_{A}=\left(p_{\alpha},p_{\beta},p_{\alpha\perp},p_{\beta\perp}\right)$
\end_inset

 encodes the probabilities of Bob accepting Alice won (which alone is of
 relevance in the single-shot analysis), Bob deducing he has won (TODO:
 what does Alice do in this case? does this outcome require Alice to know
 that Bob deduced he won and so she also outputs the same thing? How do
 we handle disagreement?), Alice aborting and finally that of Bob catching
 Alice cheating and thus aborting (since Bob is honest).
 We assume that a cheating Alice never aborts (because we assume she would
 rather have a result for the coin flip than aborting).
 Thus, we restrict to 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}_{A}=(p_{\alpha},p_{\beta},0,p_{\beta\perp})$
\end_inset

.
 The set of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}_{A}$
\end_inset

 (which encodes the possible probabilities of the various outcomes when
 Alice cheats) is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 One can analogously define 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}_{B}=(p_{\alpha},p_{\beta},p_{\alpha\perp},0)$
\end_inset

.
